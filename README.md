# 🐐 A Game About Killing Goats or Something (Beta)
![Game Preview](Media/gameplay.gif)
Yes, the title is exactly what it sounds like.  
**A Game About Killing Goats or Something** is an **arcade FPS** where explosive goats aggressively pursue you for reasons no one fully understands.

Your mission?  
**Shoot goats. Don’t get hit. Don’t explode. Repeat.**

> ⚠️ **This is a BETA**  
> Things may break. Goats may behave strangely. That’s part of the experience.

## 🎮 Gameplay (or whatever you want to call this)

- First-person shooter
- Goats that **run at you and explode**
- Infinite ammo (because realism is overrated)
- Each magazine has **5 bullets**
- Shoot a goat → it explodes
- Let a goat hit you → you take damage
- Get hit **twice in a row before regenerating** → *you* explode
- The goal is to kill **as many goats as possible before becoming goat shrapnel**

There is no story.  
There is only goats.

## ▶️ How to Play

The playable build is available in the **Releases** section of this repository.

Just download it, run it, and start eliminating goats.

## 🔫 Combat Philosophy

- Shoot first  
- Reload sometimes  
- Panic often  
- Explode occasionally  

The longer you survive, the worse your life choices become.
